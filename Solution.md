#Possible Solution
##The Hive
The hive is the data store, this is where projects live

##The Queen
The queen directs the worker bees to do work

##Worker Bee
Worker bees do tasks and output results

Each of the above are a collection of containers.
Any state needed by worker bees will be shared to the next worker bee.
